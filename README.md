# futoshiki-godot
a futoshiki game in godot and c#

Managed to copy over the massive and ugly 'Board.cs' script from a unity project (it's all POCO - plain ol c object) and got it working without much trouble.

Then I learned that godot with c#/mono can't export to webGL, and lost a lot of motivation to finish the project. We'll see.
